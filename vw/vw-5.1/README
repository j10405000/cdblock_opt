This is the vowpal wabbit fast online learning code.  It is Copyright
(c) 2009 Yahoo! Inc, and released for use under the BSD (revised) open
source license.

Contributing authors are John Langford (Primary), Lihong Li, Alex
Strehl, and Shubham Chopra, and Gordon Rios.  This is the second VW
release, and our intention is to create an open source project this
time.

Checked into github with clone URL:
git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git

To get the code install git -- in a clean directory:

git clone git://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit.git

Gordon created a tag for the completely stock initial distribution '2.3'
so to check out that original release and create a branch based on it:

git checkout 2.3
git checkout -b from-2.3

Or, in one command:

git checkout -b from-2.3 2.3
